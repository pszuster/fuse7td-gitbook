# Intro

Ignite is an integration platform. With Ignite, you can obtain data from an application or service, operate on that data if you need to, and then send the data to a completely different application or service. No coding is required to accomplish this.

### **1. How Ignite works**

Ignite lets you enable data transfer between different applications. For example, each time a customer is mentioned in Twitter, you might want to capture that mention in your Salesforce account for that customer. Another example is a service that makes stock trade recommendations. You can capture recommendations of interest and forward them to a service that automates stock transfers.

Ignite provides a web browser interface that lets you integrate two or more different applications or services without writing code. It also provides features that allow you to introduce code if it is needed for complex use cases.

To create and run a simple integration, the main steps are:

1. Create a connection to each application that you want to integrate. 
2. Select the start connection. This connection is to the application that contains the data that you want to share with another application. 
3. Select the finish connection. This connection is to the application that receives data from the start connection and that completes the integration. 
4. Map data fields from the start connection to data fields in the finish connection. 
5. Give the integration a name. 
6. Click Publish to start running the integration. The Ignite dashboard lets you monitor and manage integrations. You can see which integrations are running, start, stop, and edit integrations.

### 1.2. Who Ignite is for

Ignite is for business experts in, for example, finance, human resources, or marketing, who do not want to write code in order to share data between two different applications. Their use of a variety of software-as-a-service \(SaaS\) applications gives them an understanding of business requirements, workflows, and relevant data.

### 1.3. Benefits of Ignite 

With Ignite, you can:

Integrate data from different applications or services without writing code. Run the integration on OpenShift in the public cloud or on site. Use the visual data mapper to map data fields in one application to data fields in another application. Leverage all the benefits of open source software. You can extend features, and customize interfaces. If Ignite does not provide a connector for an application or service that you want to integrate then a developer can create the connector that you need.
